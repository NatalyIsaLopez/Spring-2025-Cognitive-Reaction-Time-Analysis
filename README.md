# Spring-2025-Cognitive-Reaction-Time-Analysis

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis pipeline for Spring 2025 behavioral data collected in the Building Blocks of Cognition Lab. It processes trial-level PsychoPy keypress logs from a cognitive task using Python, pandas, and seaborn to quantify how different experimental conditions affect accuracy and reaction time at both the participant and group level. The workflow includes multi-file ingestion, rigorous preprocessing (valid-response filtering, handling missing values, and within-subject winsorization of reaction times), and construction of participant-by-condition summary features such as mean accuracy, mean and standard deviation of reaction time, log-transformed RT, and within-subject z-scored RT.

The analysis then applies correlation analyses and paired t-tests to characterize condition effects and the speed–accuracy tradeoff, and generates visualization assets including violin plots, participant-level trajectory plots, and condition-level point plots with standard error bars. The results show that the more demanding condition yields substantially slower responses and a small but statistically reliable reduction in accuracy, consistent with increased cognitive control demands under higher task difficulty!
